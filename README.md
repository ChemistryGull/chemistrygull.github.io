This is still under development...
Here is a list of my projects:

## Balls
A physics engine written in vanilla JS. 

## GullScreen
Some ball jumping and stuff. (Moved to Balls)
May work on it in the future?

## MiniGames
Some MiniGames I developed / will develop in the future.

### Sudoku
Well its sudoku. Dosn't do much now, will add functionality later.

## MRST Project

A test site for our MRST Project. Just to test HTML/CSS/JS compatibility with mobile devices.
Also some Links here.

## PlanarMaze

A game designed by me. Still under development.

## Plants_Gruene
I grew some seeds i got from "Die Gr√ºnen". I took pictures of the seeds and placed them in a grid to compare them when they grow. This grid is displayed there.

## Privat
None of your business

## QR_0304-Project
Transforms an array of URLs to QR-Codes and puts them on a A4 layout to print them out. Still under development and not usable without having access to the code. Will probably add that later.

## Schmierzettel

A place to store all your precious URLs, with Title, Description an hashtags. Also includes Filter and Search mechanism. Stores data via LocalStorage in browser or lets you download a file as an Backup. It is also possible to customize font and theme color. This project is already usable, i for myself use it to save URLs. Anyways, it will still be updated and many features (eg files or URL groups) may soon be added.
