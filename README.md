*This is still under development...*
Here is a list of my projects:

## OpenPlanarWorlds
**Currently working on!**
A procedurally generated top down (as in 90° for now) 2D world! It will aim to be fully costumizable in the future by changing values/adding code in a single preset file. All generation should will be seed dependent and reporducable.

Currently working with the Canvas API. May port to WebGL/WebGPU with some gameengine like three.js or pixi.js in the future. To increase performance, some JS code may be replaced with WebAssembly - compiled from Rust.

## Balls
A physics engine written in vanilla JS. 

## GullScreen
Some ball jumping and stuff. (Moved to Balls)
~~May work on it in the future?~~ *Dropped, developement may continue in project Balls*

## MiniGames
Some MiniGames I developed / may develop in the future.

### Sudoku
Well its sudoku. Dosn't do much now, will add functionality later (maybe).

## MRST Project

A test site for our MRST Project. Just to test HTML/CSS/JS compatibility with mobile devices.
Also some Links here.

## PlanarMaze

A game designed by me. ~~Still under development.~~ *Discontinued, ideas and stuff I learned are now used in OpenPlanarWorlds*

## Plants_Gruene
I grew some seeds i got from "Die Grünen". I took pictures of the seeds and placed them in a grid to compare them when they grow. This grid is displayed there.

## Privat
None of your business

## QR_0304-Project
Transforms an array of URLs to QR-Codes and puts them on a A4 layout to print them out. Still under development and not usable without having access to the code. Will probably add that later (or not, ask me if you are interested).

## Schmierzettel

A place to store all your precious URLs, with Title, Description an hashtags. Also includes Filter and Search mechanism. Stores data via LocalStorage in browser or lets you download a file as an Backup. It is also possible to customize font and theme color. This project is already usable, i for myself use it to save URLs. Anyways, it will still be updated and many features (eg files or URL groups) may soon (*as in never, idk it has been two years*) be added.
