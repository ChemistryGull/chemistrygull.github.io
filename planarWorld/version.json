    "jagged_coastline": "Currently, when the Desert meets an ocean, the coastline can look wierd. This happens because the Desert forces the land (c) higer (freature, to reduce water), but when it conmes in contact with an ocean, it does not succeed (oceans are too deep, feature). Because the Climate gradients hve jagged edges, so gets the shorline the same shape. SOLUTION: Rework Water Management? Make Biome Edges less Jagged in general?",
