  "description": "This is the basic little advanced groundwork for any Map-focused 2d tile game + IMG TILES",
  "changeLog": [
    "ADDED in settings.js: tileTextures types. Those prevent e.g. tree placement in water.",
    "ADDED in distributionFunctions.js: Found to 0 when bumpDist.find() value is lower than 0.0001 -> Prevents from only Certain plant spawning in area with low probability but no competition",
    "ADDED in entity.js: support for mulitple stages and Textures for each object",
    "ADDED: Multiple Objects",
    "ADDED in settings.js: biome list with densityTrees()",
    "ADDED in entity.js: Obj.grow() makes a plant grow",
    "ADDED in entity.js: Randomnes to Obj.grow(). every time a object wants to grow, it has a S.plantGrowthSuccessChance % chance to fail"

  ],
  "bugs": {
    "jagged_coastline": "Currently, when the Desert meets an ocean, the coastline can look wierd. This happens because the Desert forces the land (c) higer (freature, to reduce water), but when it conmes in contact with an ocean, it does not succeed (oceans are too deep, feature). Because the Climate gradients hve jagged edges, so gets the shorline the same shape. SOLUTION: Rework Water Management? Make Biome Edges less Jagged in general?",
    "eval_in_inventory": "DnD.invBuildup uses eval() to figure out what inventories are currently open. YOU SHOULD NOT USE eval()!!! CHANGE THAT!!",
    "biomeList_Update": "take some time to update BiomeList .denityTrees(). maybe make a visualisation for it?",
    "plants_growing_outOfRenderDistance": "Plants that are out of render distance dont grow past one stage (the Obj.timeOfLastGrow is reset with every growing cycle)"
